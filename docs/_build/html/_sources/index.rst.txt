A-Profiles is a python library dedicated to the analysis of atmospheric profilers measurements.

Using elastic measurements performed by Lidars and/or ceilometers, A-Profiles provides clouds detection, planetary boundary layer height retrieval, and aerosol extinction calculation using some a priori.

A-Profiles supports `E-PROFILE <https://e-profile.eu/#/cm_profile>`_ data reading. This library is used by `V-Profiles <https://aerocom-vprofiles.met.no>`_.
