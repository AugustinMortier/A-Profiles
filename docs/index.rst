*A-Profiles* is a python library dedicated to the analysis of atmospheric profilers measurements.

Using elastic measurements performed by Lidars and/or ceilometers, *A-Profiles* incudes several modules such as the detection of clouds or the tracking of the planetary boundary layer height.
*A-Profiles* also allows for the retrieval of aerosol properties (extinction, mass concentration) using some a priori.

At present time, *A-Profiles* supports `E-PROFILE <https://e-profile.eu/#/cm_profile>`_ data reading. This library is used by `V-Profiles <https://aerocom-vprofiles.met.no>`_.
